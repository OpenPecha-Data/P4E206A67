All the marvellous explanations of the profound and vast teachings excellently revealed by Lord
Buddha which were composed by these scholars from the noble land of India can open the
eyes of intelligence in anyone who has discerning awareness. That these teachings are still
being studied, reflected and meditated upon today, and have not diminished after almost
2550 years, is due to the kindness of these great scholars. I therefore composed this prayer
to remember their kindness and, with unwavering faith, aspire to follow in their footsteps.
At this time, when the whole world has witnessed tremendous advancement in the fields of science
and technology, but we are also greatly distracted by the hustle and bustle of our hectic
lives, it is crucially important for all of us who follow the Buddha to develop faith
based upon an understanding of the Buddha’s Dharma teachings. Therefore we should investigate
them, by analyzing and inquiring with an unbiased and inquisitive mind. If we are to
develop this faith that is supported by understanding, the outstanding works of the profound
and vast traditions composed by the masters universally renowned as the ‘Six Ornaments
and Two Supreme Ones’, as well as others such as Buddhapālita and Ārya Vimuktisena are indispensable.
With this in mind, I commissioned the painting of a thangka depicting seventeen
of the most learned and accomplished masters of Nālandā, adding nine other masters from
the profound and the vast lineages to the traditional thangka arrangement for the Six Ornaments
and Two Supreme Ones. Together with this, I felt inspired to compose a prayer such as
this, out of heartfelt devotion to these great learned masters, and several of my sincere
Dharma friends also encouraged me. So it was that I, the buddhist monk Tenzin Gyatso, who
has gained confident and uncontrived faith in the excellent works of these learned masters
and who belongs amongst the lowest of those to have studied their masterful compositions,
wrote this ‘Prayer to Kindle the Three Kinds of Faith, Addressed to the Seventeen Great
Paṇḍitas of Glorious Nalanda.’
It was completed at Thekchen Chöling, Dharamsala, in the Kangra District of Himachal Pradesh
in India, on the first day of the eleventh month of the Iron Snake year in the seventeenth
calendrical cycle (15th December 2001), 2545 years after the Buddha according to the Theravadin
system.
May it be virtuous!
